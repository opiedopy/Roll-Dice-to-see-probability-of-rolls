Here's a cleaned-up and improved version of the dice-rolling program, optimized for clarity and learning purposes. I've simplified the variable names, improved the structure, and added comments to make it easier for you and your grandson to understand.dice_roller.pypythonâ€¢Improvements Made:

Simplified Variables: Reduced the number of variables by using lists (counts and pairs) instead of individual variables for each die value and pair.
Clearer Structure: Organized the code with comments and logical sections for easier understanding.
Improved Output: Formatted output with f-strings for readability and added a welcome message and separator lines.
